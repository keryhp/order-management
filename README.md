### Coding Challenge - Order Management

The task is to build an Order Management system able to calculate instrument prices and trade with clients.

Please see the attached PDF under /resources/CodingChallenge-OrderManagement.pdf for the requirement

### Assumptions made on top of the given requirements
1. "Orders with the same symbol can come from many different sources" - an additional field source would be necessary
2. "the application should maintain some state"
        - the application should return to the same or previous state upon restart and should be recoverable - example if a price is calculated for a client, upon restart ofg the application the trade processing should continue from that step (nice to have)
        - individual unique requests should be served only once: example 1 new order should only create 1 order (even after retrials/restarts) 
3.
